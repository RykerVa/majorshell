I have made these files to test out variants of the code for a fake shell. Two of these files have a main function but compile with the the other two files. The two files with main functions are shell1.c and myShellMain.c. They do work with myShell.c and myShell.h. 

I did not make these files with the intent of turning them in. Only for practice and testing different versions of the main file. I will still make another file for my section of the code and I will add that to the correct gitlab when(/if) the TAs make it. 

Please let me know if you want to add or if you have a comment on anything.

I only compiled it with g++ ...... and ./a.out
